“Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed but it can be transformed from one form to another”. Following the principle of Conservation of Energy the Regenerative Braking System works.
Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that slows a vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy into a form that can be either used immediately or stored until needed.
The kinetic Energy is then converted into Electrical energy using Generator or Alternator and the electricity is stored in Battery or Capacitor.
Regenerative Braking System (RBS) is an efficient system to reduce vehicle emission, fuel consumption and decreases the wear and tear in the brake drum due to heat produced by the friction.
